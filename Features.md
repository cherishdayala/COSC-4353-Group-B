Features for Graph Quest:
1. Turns user input from standard input into a graph of nodes and edges
2. Can filter graph/data frame through searches/minimum spanning trees and produce new graph/data frame
3. Allow for graph manipulation such as adding adn removing nodes, adding and removing edges, and saving data to specific nodes

Work in progress: 
4. Implements NetworkX to graph pandas data frame

5. Allows user to perform search and other graph algorithms such as Breadth first search, Depth first search, Djikstra's and Cycle detection on graph data structure
6. Can create pictures of graphs using NetworkX
